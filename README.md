# Soup Image Classifier

A deep learning model deployment project that classifies different types of soups using pretrained efficientnet model.

## 🍜 Project Overview

This project implements a soup classification system using deep learning techniques. It can identify various types of soups from images, making it useful for food recognition applications, restaurant menu systems, or dietary tracking apps. It also incorporate a Google's gemini based conversational bot that provides expert opinion about the identified soup.

## 🚀 Features

- Real-time soup classification from images
- Support for multiple soup categories
- Conversationl bot
- Pre-trained model for immediate use
- Docker support for containerized deployment

## 🛠️ Technical Stack

- Python 3.8+
- Pytorch
- Streamlit
- Google Gemini

## 📋 Prerequisites

- Python 3.8 or higher
- pip package manager
- CUDA-compatible GPU (optional, for faster inference)
